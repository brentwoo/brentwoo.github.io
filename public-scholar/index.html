	<p>One of my missions is to bring the work of linguists more into public awareness. I'm fulfulfilled and feel at home on the stage. I once gave a TEDx talk on language technology, to enthusiastic reception. I'm also the only person who has worked at both the Linguist List and the Linguistic Society of America. I worked with the LSA on advocacy intiiatives and lobbied legislative staff in Washington, DC. I've brought linguistics to children and prisoners.</p>

I've made the logos for the LSA Annual Meeting for the past several years, and continue to do graphics consulting with them.
