I"×<p>Am I allowed to publish particularly glowing student reviews? Well, Iâ€™m going to do it anyways. Iâ€™ve always been pretty proud of my teaching, and if there was a Yelp for professors (or if people used RateMyProfessor), mine would look like this:</p>

<p>As standalone teacher:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thatâ€™s the best explanation of Saussure Iâ€™ve ever heard. (Comment from student who was an emeritus professor of literature, Sum16)</p>

  <p>Brent was very passionate about his work and teaching us about those passions. â€¦ Youâ€™re a wonderful teacher. (LING 462 Syntax, Sum15)</p>

  <p>Extremely [intellectually stimulating]! This class is a fascinating mix of theory and functional exercises. It made the students (myself included) really think outside the box and theorize in very interesting ways. The homeworks were particularly good â€“ they really made me think, and apply the theories of the class.  (LING 462 Syntax, Sum15)</p>

<p>As TA:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Brent helped me understand course material much more than I would have in lecture. â€¦ Brent has a way of making this subject fun and interesting. (LING 233, Spr15)</p>

  <p>Brent was really good at asking the students to test their learning/progression. It was a good environment to review our questions and participate. (LING 233, Spr15)</p>

  <p>Discussion sections were not only intellectually stimulating but also very enjoyable. They werenâ€™t dull like lectures were, and your enthusiasm in teaching the material â€¦ was very helpful to further our learning experience. â€¦ Youâ€™re a very good TA :) (LING 233, Spr15)</p>

  <p>Brent was always concise and entertaining and made the material easy to digest. (LING 100, Win15)</p>
