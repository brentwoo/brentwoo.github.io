I"a<p>Every once in a while an AskReddit thread will come up that just reaps in so much linguistic gold - this one asks for “funny ways to say yes”</p>

<p>Users come up with hundreds of variants. Some of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the mitochondria the powerhouse of the cell?</li>
  <li>Do you require more pylons?</li>
  <li>Are Batman’s parents dead?</li>
  <li>Does the pope shit in his hat?</li>
  <li>Does Billy Mays have more to offer?</li>
  <li>Does a one legged frog swim in circles</li>
</ul>

<p>What’s interesting is how many are patently unfunny, though. One was even called out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is i^2 equal to - 1?
** I do maths, but this isn’t funny. It’s like saying “is 4*3 equal to 12?”. Or “ is 10 2 in binary?”</li>
</ul>

<p>Why are the funny ones funny and the unfunny ones not? Most of the ones I thought were funny invoked some kind of cultural meme. things that are so obvious and well known, that asking the question of it is stupid - which makes it funny. With the math one, there’s no “obvious” cultural meme aspect, it’s just a mere truism, or tautology.</p>
