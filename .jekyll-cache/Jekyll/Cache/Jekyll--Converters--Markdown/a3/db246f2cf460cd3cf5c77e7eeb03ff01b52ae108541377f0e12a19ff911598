<p>Iâ€™m pretty proud of myself for getting this experiment together, and it actually showed some kind of result. What exact result that is I donâ€™t know, but thereâ€™s definitely a slope on this graph.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s this all about? Iâ€™m keeping it secret until I hear back from the conference! Iâ€™m just too excited not to share the visual result, though.</p>
