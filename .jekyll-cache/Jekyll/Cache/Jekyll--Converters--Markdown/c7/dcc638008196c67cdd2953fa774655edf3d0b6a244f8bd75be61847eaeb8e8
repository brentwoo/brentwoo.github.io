I"Œ<p>I ran across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/51gyvc/after_not_taking_attendance_all_quarter_my_ta_was/d7cbijf?context=3">this Reddit post</a>. Disregarding the main post content, I thought it was interesting how much of the discussion relates the use of LaTeX with hard science and math. And in particular, the â€œlatex fontâ€ â€“ which is actually â€œComputer Modernâ€.</p>

<p>Linguists are so keen on having linguistics recognized as a field of science, so I thought this public reaction was interesting since Iâ€™m positive these people donâ€™t have linguistics in mind when they see LaTeX handouts or exams.</p>

<p>But at the same time, Iâ€™m always a little indignant â€“ Iâ€™m an avid LaTeX user, but youâ€™ll never see Computer Modern in any of my papers or handouts. I prefer to replace the font with something more pleasing, usually Charis SIL. For example, see <a href="http://people.umass.edu/kbj/homepage/Content/amalgams.pdf">Kyle Johnsonâ€™s papers, like this one on Amalgams</a>. They are made using LaTeX, yet donâ€™t have that distinctive font. They contain some startlingly complex diagrams, like the multidominant structure on page 15, which are rendered natively in the document.</p>

<p>Replacing the font makes it less likely that the paper will scream â€œmade in LaTeXâ€, therefore, trivially undermining the incorporation of linguistics into science via typography??</p>
