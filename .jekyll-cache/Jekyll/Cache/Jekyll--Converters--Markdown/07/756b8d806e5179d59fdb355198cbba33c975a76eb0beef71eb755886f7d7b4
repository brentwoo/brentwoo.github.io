I"›<p>I was playing with the Reddit API, and specifically the <a href="https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python wrapper (PRAW)</a> which makes it straightforward to grab large numbers of post titles or comments. I donâ€™t have any current research questions about it, but I thought Iâ€™d do some butterfly collecting with coordinators. So, Iâ€™m just curious: do subreddits use coordinators differently?</p>
