I"Õ<p>Right now Iâ€™m designing the syllabus and course schedule for a small introductory linguistics class at UW: LING 400 â€œSurvey of Linguistic Method and Theoryâ€. Iâ€™m using <em>Language Files</em> as the textbook, and while itâ€™s a very good textbook, I was interested at the fact that it ends many chapters with a section relating the main text to sign languages. For example, after the discussion of oral phonetics, there is a section on manual phonetics.</p>
