I"³<p>I was talking with a student at office hours about Formal Languages, and the discussion dredged up all sorts of memories about old work Iâ€™ve done. In particular, I was resminiscing about this phase when I was really into the idea of automata, and their generalization across domains, not just natural language. Coffee was a target, so I put together a finite state automata that would generate all coffee and espresso drinks.</p>
