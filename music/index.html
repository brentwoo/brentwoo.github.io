I am an active freelance musician in the Seattle WA area. I specialize in classical ensembles and event music on keyboards and lever harp. I have accompanied every flavor of solo musician, for classical conservatory juries, church services, and auditions. I thrive in collaborations such as musical pit orchestra and chamber groups, but I'm also completely at home providing event music on my own. I've played dozens of weddings on piano and lever harp and worked as a hotel lounge pianist for several seasons.
