	<p>I am a PhD student in Linguistics at UW. I practice syntax, currently focusing on coordination and related topics like Right Node Raising and idioms. I have a growing interest in experimental syntax, esp. judgments and transposition. I also enjoy building computational grammars in HPSG/LFG; so far I've worked on Rusyn and Burmese. I'm most interested in Uralic and Slavic languages, having studied Russian for several years and, newly, Finnish. </p>

<p>One of my missions is to bring the work of linguists more into public awareness. To that end, I once gave a TEDx talk on language technology. I'm also the only person who has worked at both the Linguist List and the Linguistic Society of America. </p>

	<p>I enjoy playing <a href="https://vimeo.com/75281007">incredibly loud keyboard instruments</a> and reading sad books.</p>

I've made the logos for the LSA Annual Meeting for the past several years, and continue to do graphics consulting with them.
