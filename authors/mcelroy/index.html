	<p>I'm developing a resource page for the author <b>Joseph McElroy</b>. His books are rare, usually out-of-print, expensive, and hard-to-find. The official author site is outdated and links are all broken. Here I want to maintain a list of essays and articles, as well as information about his books.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Essays</h2>
	McElroy's essays are difficult to find online. Please let me know if you want me to remove these for whatever reason.
	<ul>
		<li> 1992. "<a href="{{ site.url }}/authors/mcelroy/McElroy1992-Fiction.pdf">Fiction a field of growth: Science at Heart, Action at a distance</a>". in American Book Review 14(1).
		<li> 1974. "<a href="{{ site.url }}/authors/mcelroy/McElroy1974-NeuralNeighbor.pdf">Neural Neighborhoods and other concrete abstracts</a>"

I've made the logos for the LSA Annual Meeting for the past 3 years, and continue to do graphics consulting with them.
