I'm reading Steinbeck's <i>Travels with Charley (in Search of America)</i>, which is this adorable tale of him driving cross-country with his French Poodle, Charley. He makes all sorts of pithy remarks on the people and places he visits. 

This got me thinking about my own travels. I'm kind of obsessed with tracking everything I do -- Strava for every little run and bike ride, Goodreads for every page read, Instagram for every fancy dinner I have (if that's gamification, I fully submit myself to it). And I know people track their travels in maps like this. 

The really fun thing is, is that this was done in LaTeX. I found a <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/183087/draw-colored-world-us-map-in-latex">StackExchange post</a> giving some details about how to do this, and I made a map showing my own travels. The darkest blue are states that I've lived in (with lines showing big moves), and the lighter blues I've spent at least a night in.
