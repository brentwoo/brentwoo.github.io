All done! Went through about 6 different versions to arrive at this simple and clean letter-based logo. No mountains or city skylines this time, but that's okay.

Now, if someone could teach me how to do Layer Blends in Overlay mode in a vector file, that'd be great. I made this using photoshop and pseudo text vectors, but it's still not a proper EPS or print format.
