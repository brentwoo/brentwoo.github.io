I'm pretty proud of myself for getting this experiment together, and it actually showed some kind of result. What exact result that is I don't know, but there's definitely a slope on this graph.

What's this all about? I'm keeping it secret until I hear back from the conference! I'm just too excited not to share the visual result, though.
