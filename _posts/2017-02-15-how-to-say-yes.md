Every once in a while an AskReddit thread will come up that just reaps in so much linguistic gold - this one asks for "funny ways to say yes"

Users come up with hundreds of variants. Some of my favorites:

* Is the mitochondria the powerhouse of the cell?
* Do you require more pylons?
* Are Batman's parents dead?
* Does the pope shit in his hat?
* Does Billy Mays have more to offer?
* Does a one legged frog swim in circles

What's interesting is how many are patently unfunny, though. One was even called out:

* Is i^2 equal to - 1?
** I do maths, but this isn't funny. It's like saying "is 4*3 equal to 12?". Or " is 10 2 in binary?"

Why are the funny ones funny and the unfunny ones not? Most of the ones I thought were funny invoked some kind of cultural meme. things that are so obvious and well known, that asking the question of it is stupid - which makes it funny. With the math one, there's no "obvious" cultural meme aspect, it's just a mere truism, or tautology.
