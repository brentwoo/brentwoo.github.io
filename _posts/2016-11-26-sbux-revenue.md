I learned how to make a <a href="https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2016/05/27/excel-cumulative-sum-running-total/">running totals column in Excel</a>, and used a "Filled Radar" chart for the first time -- I thought it showed the hourly fluctuations particularly well, since it's an hourly report and the chart resembles a clock.
